He often takes detailed notes, replays explanations to reinforce his understanding, and performs well in exams that test listening comprehension.

      "Description": "He learns best through discussions, group activities, and peer interactions. He gains deeper understanding by asking questions, debating ideas, and explaining concepts to others. For example, he may prefer study groups, classroom debates, or role-playing exercises where he can actively engage with classmates. He struggles with passive listening and needs social stimulation to retain information. He benefits from collaborative projects, brainstorming sessions, and real-time feedback from peers. His learning improves when he verbalizes his thoughts, challenges assumptions, and refines his knowledge through conversation."
